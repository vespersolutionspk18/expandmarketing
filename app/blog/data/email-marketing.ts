    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Despite what social media gurus will tell you, email marketing still delivers an average ROI of $42 for every $1 spent. No other channel comes close. Why? Because you own your email list. The algorithm can't take it away. The platform can't sunset overnight.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Email subscribers are your most valuable audience. They've actively chosen to hear from you. They check their inbox daily. They're higher-intent than social media followers. The question isn't whether email works—it's whether you're doing it right.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">List Segmentation: The ROI Multiplier</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Sending the same email to your entire list is leaving money on the table. Segmented campaigns drive 760% more revenue than one-size-fits-all broadcasts. Here's how to segment effectively:</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Behavioral Segmentation:</strong> Group subscribers based on actions—what they've clicked, what they've purchased, which pages they've visited. Someone who viewed your pricing page five times needs a different message than someone who just subscribed to your blog.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Engagement-Based Segmentation:</strong> Your most engaged subscribers should get your best content first. Your dormant subscribers need a re-engagement campaign. Don't waste your highest-value offers on people who never open your emails.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Customer Journey Segmentation:</strong> New subscribers, active customers, churned customers—each needs different messaging. Stop treating a loyal customer of 3 years the same as someone who signed up yesterday.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Automation Workflows That Print Money</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">If you're still manually sending every email, you're doing it wrong. These automation workflows should be running 24/7:</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Welcome Series:</strong> New subscribers are most engaged in their first 48 hours. A 5-email welcome series that educates, builds trust, and makes a soft offer converts at 320% higher rates than single welcome emails.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Abandoned Cart Series:</strong> The average cart abandonment rate is 70%. A well-crafted 3-email abandoned cart sequence can recover 15-20% of those lost sales. Email 1 at 1 hour (reminder), Email 2 at 24 hours (social proof), Email 3 at 72 hours (urgency/discount if needed).</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Post-Purchase Series:</strong> The sale isn't the end—it's the beginning. Onboarding emails, usage tips, cross-sell opportunities, review requests. Turn one-time buyers into repeat customers.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Re-engagement Campaign:</strong> When subscribers go dormant (no opens in 90 days), send a win-back series. Offer value, ask what they want to hear about, make it easy to update preferences. If they still don't engage, remove them—they're hurting your deliverability.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Deliverability: The Hidden Revenue Killer</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">You could write the world's best email, but if it lands in spam, it's worthless. Deliverability should be your top priority. Authenticate your domain (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). Warm up new sending domains gradually. Monitor your sender reputation. Clean your list regularly.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">The biggest deliverability killer? Continuing to email people who never engage. It signals to ISPs that recipients don't want your emails. Be ruthless about list hygiene. A smaller engaged list outperforms a large unengaged list every time.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Writing Emails People Actually Read</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Your subject line determines whether the email gets opened. Your first sentence determines whether it gets read. Your call-to-action determines whether it drives results. Most email copy fails at all three.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Subject lines: Be specific, create curiosity or urgency, keep it under 50 characters. Test relentlessly. A 2% improvement in open rates compounds into massive revenue differences over time.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900 mb-0!">Body copy: Write like a human, not a corporation. Get to the point fast. Use short paragraphs and plenty of white space. Make your CTA crystal clear. One email, one goal. Stop trying to achieve five things in a single message.</p>
