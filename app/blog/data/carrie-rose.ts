    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">CEO & Founder of Expand Marketing, and my job is to be out in the market and see which way the wind is blowing and bring that home to my team and clients. I lead the vision of the agency across multiple markets.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">ðŸ§­ Where did it all start for you?</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">I have 12 years in the SEO and content marketing space, starting in Digital PR and copywriting for SEO, then leading cross-channel content strategies and multi-platform campaigns. I spent 5 years working on one of the hardest accounts, Ladbrokes, which is where I combined my passion for the best technical & creative work in a highly competitive niche. I truly believe that if you can market gambling, you can market anything.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">I took my learnings and applied them to insurance, leading major brands to success, then Travel, Finance, Fashion, Beauty and many more.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">I spotted a massive gap in the industry where big advertising and influencer campaigns were generating search demand, and the brand failed to capture it (because they didn't rank). I felt that demand and discovery needed to work more closely togetherâ€”that's exactly why Expand Marketing was born.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">I hired 50% of the best technically minded marketers and 50% of the best creative marketers, put them in an agency together, and we created magic. I have scaled the agency and worked with some of the biggest brands in the world to create category leaders online.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">ðŸ“š Experience so far:</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">I have experience working in nearly every niche and industry from B2B, to retail, finance, health, fashion and more.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">I personally have the best knowledge and skillset in retail, travel and gambling and I'm passionate about fashion and beauty. When I'm not out in the market or running the business, I love to work closely with our strategists - that's what I'm great at.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">âš¡ What I'm best at:</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">I'm a great marketer. That's what I am. I think over the years, I've become a good generalist marketer, understanding the full funnel and the role we all play in driving customer acquisition. I'm an expert at the messy middle part of the user journey and how we can move consumers through it faster and cheaper.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">But the two things that make me stand out are my ability to position brands in a blue ocean, to have a competitive edge and a creative strategy that leaves competitors chasing my clients' tails. I'm an ideas person.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">ðŸ”¥ Strong opinion I have about my craft:</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">"Whilst the marketing industry is chasing algorithms, we are consumers. Consumers are moving faster than algorithms, and all these platforms are doing with all their updates and advancements is figuring out humans as much as possible. Not enough marketing work gets in the minds of people, and that's where it is going wrong"</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">ðŸŽ¢ Fun fact:</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">I got my start in the industry by doing what I do best - spotting opportunity where no one else is looking. I was 19, on a train, and clocked a guy in a suit who looked like he knew things. So I sat opposite him and started a conversation.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900 mb-0!">It turned out he worked at a major tech company and had just launched an innovative product. A few bold questions later, I walked away with a summer internship - and that's where the journey began.</p>
