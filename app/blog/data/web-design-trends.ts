    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Every year, design blogs publish lists of "must-have" trends. Most are fleeting aesthetic choices that will look dated in 18 months. But some trends represent genuine shifts in user expectations and web technology. The key is knowing which is which.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">The trends that matter are those that improve user experience, increase conversion rates, or solve real problems. Everything else is just decoration. Let's focus on what actually moves the needle for businesses.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Performance Is Not Optional Anymore</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Core Web Vitals are now a ranking factor. Users abandon sites that load slowly. A one-second delay in page load time can reduce conversions by 7%. Performance isn't a trend—it's table stakes. But achieving great performance in 2025 looks different than it did five years ago.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Modern performance means: aggressive image optimization (WebP and AVIF formats), lazy loading everything below the fold, minimizing JavaScript bundles, leveraging edge computing and CDNs, implementing proper caching strategies, and using modern frameworks like Next.js or Astro that prioritize performance out of the box.</p>

    </figure>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Mobile-First Is Dead. Mobile-Only Is Reality.</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">60-70% of web traffic comes from mobile devices. For many sites, it's even higher. Yet most designers still design for desktop first and adapt for mobile as an afterthought. This backwards approach shows in the user experience.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Modern web design means: designing for thumb-reach zones, making buttons and interactive elements large enough for fingers (minimum 44x44px), simplifying navigation for small screens, ensuring text is readable without zooming (minimum 16px), and testing everything on actual devices, not just responsive simulators.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">The Rise of Micro-Interactions</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Subtle animations and interactions aren't just aesthetic choices—they're functional feedback mechanisms that guide users and provide context. A button that provides haptic feedback and visual confirmation when pressed. A form field that shows inline validation. A loading state that uses skeleton screens instead of spinners.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">These micro-interactions reduce cognitive load, prevent errors, and create a sense of responsiveness that makes the interface feel alive. But there's a fine line between delightful and annoying. Animations should be fast (under 300ms), meaningful, and skippable.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Accessibility Is a Design Requirement</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">15% of the world's population has some form of disability. Designing accessible websites isn't charity—it's smart business. Plus, many accessibility features improve the experience for everyone. Clear hierarchy, sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML benefit all users.</p>

    <figure class="w-full border border-solid border-grey-200 mb-5 overflow-hidden rounded-2xl">
      <img style="aspect-ratio:16/9;" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/669615/pexels-photo-669615.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=800&q=80&fit=crop" width="1200" height="675" alt="" class="block !w-full relative !h-auto rounded-lg mb-5">
    </figure>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Modern accessibility means: maintaining WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as a minimum, ensuring 4.5:1 color contrast ratios for normal text, providing alt text for all images, enabling keyboard navigation for all interactive elements, using ARIA labels appropriately, and testing with actual screen readers.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Personalization and Dynamic Content</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Static websites are becoming relics. Modern sites adapt to the user—showing different content based on location, behavior, referral source, or previous interactions. Someone landing from a PPC ad sees different messaging than an organic visitor. A returning customer sees different content than a first-time visitor.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">This level of personalization requires thoughtful implementation. Don't personalize just because you can. Personalize when it genuinely improves the user experience and drives better outcomes. And always respect privacy—be transparent about data usage and give users control.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Minimalism That Actually Works</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Minimalism doesn't mean removing everything. It means removing everything that isn't necessary. Every element on your page should have a purpose. If it doesn't help the user accomplish their goal or support your business objective, cut it.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Modern minimalism means: generous white space that lets content breathe, clear visual hierarchy that guides attention, limited color palettes that create cohesion, thoughtful typography that enhances readability, and strategic use of imagery that supports the message rather than decorating it.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Design for Conversion, Not Awards</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Beautiful design that doesn't convert is just expensive art. Your website's job is to drive business results. Every design decision should be evaluated through the lens of user experience and conversion optimization.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900 mb-0!">Test everything. Use heatmaps to see where users actually click. Run A/B tests on critical pages. Analyze drop-off points in your funnel. The best design is the one that achieves your business goals, not the one that wins design awards. Sometimes the highest-converting design is surprisingly simple and "boring." That's okay. Results matter more than aesthetics.</p>
