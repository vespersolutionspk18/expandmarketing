    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Let's address the elephant in the room: organic reach on most platforms is abysmal. You could have 100,000 followers and still only reach 2-5% of them with a typical post. The algorithms have changed. The platforms want you to pay to play.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">But here's the thing: while organic reach has declined, engagement rates for truly great content have actually increased. The algorithms reward content that generates meaningful interactions—saves, shares, comments with substance. Stop chasing vanity metrics and start creating content worth engaging with.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Platform-Specific Strategies That Work</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Instagram:</strong> Reels are not optional—they're essential. The algorithm heavily favors video content, particularly Reels. But don't just repurpose TikToks. Create native Instagram content that feels natural to the platform. Use trending audio, but add your unique perspective.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> The platform has transformed from a resume repository to a genuine content platform. Long-form posts (1,300+ characters) with a strong hook perform exceptionally well. Share genuine insights from your work. Document your process. Be helpful, not promotional.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>TikTok:</strong> Entertainment value is paramount. Even B2B brands can succeed here, but you need to make your content engaging first, educational second. The first 3 seconds determine whether someone keeps watching. Hook them immediately.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Twitter/X:</strong> The platform rewards consistency and conversation. Post multiple times daily. Engage in replies. Share genuine insights, not just promotional content. Threads still perform well for in-depth analysis.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">The Content Matrix Approach</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Don't create content in silos. Use a content matrix approach: create one substantial piece of content (a detailed guide, a comprehensive video, an original research study), then atomize it into 20+ micro-content pieces across platforms.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">One client case study becomes: a carousel post breaking down the results, a Reel showing the transformation, a Twitter thread highlighting key insights, a LinkedIn article with detailed analysis, and multiple Stories showcasing before/after. One core asset, dozens of platform-specific adaptations.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Community Building vs. Audience Building</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Most brands focus on audience building—growing follower counts. The smart brands focus on community building—creating genuine connections. A community of 5,000 engaged followers who actually care is infinitely more valuable than 50,000 passive followers.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Build community through: consistent engagement with comments, creating insider jokes and references, highlighting community members, hosting live sessions, creating exclusive content for your most engaged followers, and actually caring about the people who support you.</p>

      <img style="aspect-ratio:16/9;" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3184465/pexels-photo-3184465.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=800&q=80&fit=crop" width="1200" height="675" alt="" class="block !w-full relative !h-auto rounded-lg mb-5">
    </figure>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">The Algorithm Isn't Your Enemy</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Stop trying to "hack" the algorithm. The platforms want to show content that keeps users engaged. If your content genuinely engages people, the algorithm will reward it. Focus on creating content that generates saves (high intent), shares (social proof), and meaningful comments (engagement depth).</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">The metrics that matter: Save rate (people want to revisit your content), Share rate (people vouch for your content), Comment depth (are people leaving thoughtful responses?), and Profile visits (are people interested in learning more about you?).</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Consistency Beats Perfection</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">The biggest mistake brands make? Posting sporadically. They post 5 times in one week, then nothing for three weeks, then wonder why their reach keeps declining. The algorithm rewards consistency. Decide on a sustainable posting cadence and stick to it.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900 mb-0!">You're better off posting 3 times per week consistently than posting daily for two weeks and then disappearing. Build systems, create content banks, batch your content creation. But above all, show up consistently. Your audience and the algorithm both reward reliability.</p>
