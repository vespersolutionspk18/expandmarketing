    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Your sales team spends 64% of their time on non-selling activities—data entry, scheduling meetings, sending follow-up emails, updating records. That's not a productivity problem. That's a process problem. And it's costing you millions in lost revenue.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">CRM automation isn't about replacing salespeople. It's about freeing them from soul-crushing administrative work so they can do what they do best: build relationships and close deals. When implemented correctly, CRM automation can increase sales productivity by 34% and reduce sales cycle time by 18%.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">The Core Automations Every CRM Needs</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Lead Routing Automation:</strong> When a lead comes in, the CRM should automatically assign it to the right salesperson based on territory, product interest, deal size, or round-robin distribution. No manual sorting. No leads falling through cracks. Instant assignment with automated notifications.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Lead Scoring and Qualification:</strong> Not all leads are created equal. Implement behavioral and demographic scoring that automatically identifies your hottest prospects. Someone who visited your pricing page three times and downloaded two case studies scores higher than someone who just subscribed to your newsletter.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Follow-up Sequence Automation:</strong> The fortune is in the follow-up. After an initial conversation, trigger a sequence of emails that nurture the relationship. After a demo, send relevant case studies. After a proposal, share customer testimonials. Personalized at scale.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Task and Reminder Automation:</strong> When a deal moves to a new stage, automatically create the relevant tasks. Demo scheduled? Create tasks to send pre-demo materials and set up the demo environment. Proposal sent? Create a follow-up task for 3 days later. Never let deals go stale.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Data Enrichment and Hygiene</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Garbage in, garbage out. Your CRM is only as valuable as the data inside it. Implement automatic data enrichment that pulls company information, social profiles, and technographic data when a contact is created. No more manual research.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Set up deduplication workflows that automatically merge duplicate records. Create data validation rules that prevent salespeople from saving incomplete information. Implement regular data hygiene automation that flags outdated records and prompts updates.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Workflow Automations That Scale</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Pipeline Stage Automation:</strong> When a deal reaches certain criteria (demo completed, budget confirmed, decision-maker engaged), automatically move it to the next stage. When it's been stuck in a stage too long, notify the sales manager. Create automatic escalation workflows.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Meeting Automation:</strong> Integrate your CRM with scheduling tools. When someone books a meeting, automatically create the opportunity, send calendar invites with video conferencing links, send reminder emails, and create pre-meeting prep tasks. The salesperson just shows up and sells.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900"><strong>Reporting and Analytics Automation:</strong> Automatically generate and email weekly pipeline reports to your sales team. Create automated forecasting models. Set up alerts when deals are at risk. Give management real-time visibility without manual reporting.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Integration Is Everything</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Your CRM shouldn't be an island. Integrate it with your email platform, marketing automation, support system, billing software, and communication tools. When data flows seamlessly between systems, magic happens.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Example: A prospect fills out a form → Marketing automation scores and nurtures them → When they hit SQL criteria, they're automatically pushed to CRM as a lead → Lead routing assigns to the right rep → Email integration logs all communications → Meeting scheduler books the demo → CRM automatically creates the opportunity → Deal progresses through automated workflows → Closed won deals flow to billing for contract creation. Zero manual handoffs.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Common Automation Mistakes to Avoid</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Over-automation is real. Don't automate every human interaction out of the sales process. High-touch deals still require genuine human connection. Use automation to eliminate busywork, not to eliminate relationship building.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Another mistake: setting up automation and forgetting about it. Sales processes evolve. Regularly audit your workflows. Remove automations that aren't adding value. Update email templates that aren't converting. CRM automation requires ongoing optimization.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900 mb-0!">Finally, don't implement automation without training your team. The best CRM setup in the world is worthless if your sales team doesn't use it correctly. Invest in proper onboarding, documentation, and ongoing support. Adoption drives ROI.</p>
