    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">The Art and Science of PPC Optimization</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">PPC isn't just about bidding higher. It's about bidding smarter. The most successful campaigns focus on quality score, ad relevance, and landing page experience. I've managed accounts spending $500K+ monthly, and the difference between average and exceptional PPC management is often 200-300% in ROI.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Every dollar wasted on irrelevant clicks is a dollar you could have invested in reaching your actual customers. Precision targeting and continuous optimization are essential. But optimization isn't just about cutting costs—it's about maximizing value from every dollar spent.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">The Quality Score Multiplier Effect</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Quality Score isn't just a vanity metric—it's a cost multiplier. A keyword with a Quality Score of 10 can cost 50% less per click than the same keyword with a score of 5. This compounds over thousands of clicks and millions of dollars in spend.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Improving Quality Score requires alignment across the entire funnel: keyword relevance → ad copy relevance → landing page relevance. Most advertisers focus only on ad copy, but the landing page is often where scores are won or lost. Create dedicated landing pages for your highest-value keyword groups.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Advanced Bidding Strategies</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Manual CPC is dead for most campaigns. Smart Bidding algorithms have access to thousands of signals we can't see—device, location, time of day, audience, weather, and more. Target CPA and Target ROAS strategies consistently outperform manual bidding when given sufficient conversion data.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">But here's the catch: Smart Bidding is only as smart as the conversion data you feed it. If you're only tracking final purchases, you're missing out. Implement micro-conversion tracking—email signups, phone calls, chat initiations. Give the algorithm more signals to optimize toward.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">The Metrics That Actually Matter</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Click-through rate is vanity. ROI is sanity. Profit is reality. Too many advertisers celebrate high CTRs while their campaigns bleed money. A 15% CTR means nothing if those clicks don't convert or if your cost per acquisition is higher than customer lifetime value.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Focus on: <strong>Conversion Rate</strong> (are your landing pages effective?), <strong>Cost Per Acquisition</strong> (are you acquiring customers profitably?), <strong>Customer Lifetime Value to CAC Ratio</strong> (are you acquiring the right customers?), and <strong>Incremental Revenue</strong> (would these customers have found you anyway?).</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Audience Layering and Exclusions</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">One of the most underutilized optimization techniques is audience layering. Don't just bid on keywords—layer on audience segments and adjust bids based on user behavior. Someone who's visited your site three times is worth more than a cold visitor. Bid accordingly.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">Equally important: exclusions. Exclude converters from upper-funnel campaigns. Exclude researchers from your branded campaigns (they'll find you organically). Exclude your own employees, competitors, and job seekers. Every wasted click adds up.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium tracking-tight leading-none capitalize text-balance mb-4 text-grey-900 text-xl | lg:text-2xl"><strong class="font-medium">Testing: The Never-Ending Process</strong></h3>
    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900">The best PPC managers are obsessive testers. Always be running ad copy tests (minimum 2 variations per ad group). Test different landing page variations. Test different bid strategies. Test different audience combinations. But test methodically—change one variable at a time and wait for statistical significance.</p>

    <p class="text-sm font-sans-primary leading-normal text-pretty mb-5 | lg:text-base text-grey-900 mb-0!">The PPC platforms are constantly evolving. What worked last quarter might not work today. Stay curious, keep testing, and remember: optimization is a process, not a destination. The campaigns that win are those managed by teams that never stop improving.</p>
